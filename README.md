|What is a shell?|
|----------------|
|A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

|Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs.

|ABOUT MY PROJECT
|This project was written in C in order to emulate the linux sh shell and study how its background processes work.

|HOW INSTALL
|If you want to test the functionality of this shell, follow the next steps:
|(1)- Enter your terminal.
|(2)- Clone this repository.
|(3)- Compiles all the * .c files that make up this program.
|-->$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh -g*|
